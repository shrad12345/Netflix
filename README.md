# Netflix
Cleaned and preprocessed the Netflix Movies &amp; TV Shows dataset using Python (Pandas) by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and preparing the data for accurate analysis and visualization.

#Summary:- 
In this data cleaning task, I worked on a dataset containing details about movies and TV shows. I began by eliminating duplicate records to ensure data accuracy. Missing values in key fields like title were removed, while less critical fields such as description and age_certification were filled with default placeholders like "No description available" and "NR" (Not Rated). The seasons column, which is usually empty for movies, was standardized by replacing missing values with 0 and converting the data type to integer for uniformity across records.
